# Personal Website - Michelle Scaramuzzo

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and professional background, as well as a way to get in touch with me. Built as part of my coursework, this website demonstrates my abilities in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a focus on responsive design and clean, professional aesthetics.
